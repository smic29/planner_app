# Planner App

## Current Deploy:
- [Planner App(Railway)](https://plannerapp-production.up.railway.app/)
  - Currently unstable and frequently crashes.
  - Used for redis instance
- [Planner App(Render)](https://planner-app-elox.onrender.com/)
  - Full functionality.

## Changes made on this branch
- Added breakpoints to application layout so that it stacks 992px and below.
- Removed `container` classes from task index and dash index so that boxes are uniform in size.

## Thoughts:
- Maybe turn categories the category list to a toggleable container?
